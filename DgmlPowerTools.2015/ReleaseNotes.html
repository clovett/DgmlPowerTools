    <h3>Version 1.4</h3>
    <p>
        Upgrade to work in VS 2015.
        Removed FileSystemProvider since Architecture Explorer was removed from VS 2015.
    </p>
    <h3>Version 1.3</h3>
    <p>
        Upgrade to work in VS 2013 and added butterfly mode.
    </p>
    <h3>Version 1.2</h3>
    <p>
    Contains a fix so the "Save As SVG" is available again after you install the VS 2012 Update.
    It now shows up on the new Share menu in Graph Document ToolBar which is a new place created by the update.
